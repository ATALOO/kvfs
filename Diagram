Starting from root "/"
every new directory is a name of a new column family so for example:

/bin,  bin is the name of new column family.
bin is a column for itself and can have new directories :
/bin/path1/
/bin/path2/
path1 and 2 are column families individualy.

each column family has pwd key which has the full path upto root as its value.

Paths cannot have "/" as their names.

Each file is a column family, the column family name will be the file name,

has a key POSIX_FLAGS with it's flags.
has a key creation time with creation time. 
######### lass access time with last access time.
######### Blocks with block number where its data is written in BlockDB.

For writing data, we use twolevel index, partitioned indexes
we write the data as SST files.
** SST files are external from the DB which need to be ingested to the DB afterwards **

We should just us twolevel index, data DB.
